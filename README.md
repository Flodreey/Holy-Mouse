The Unity game **Holy Mouse** is a project developed by four german students at the **Technical University of Munich**.

## Description
The player finds himself in the paws of a mouse living in a church, listening to a conversation between an architect and the mayor. The mayor 
intends to demolish the building if the architect does not manage to transform it into a kindergarten within four days. In order not to lose his home, 
the mouse decides to help the architect with a series of tasks (henceforth quests).

In each of the four nights until the imminent demolition, the mouse must master a different task. The lighting conditions are kept quite dark, because 
the mouse can only work at night. At the beginning of the level, the specific task and the goal are explained to the player by means of a text box.

### Quest 1 - Remove unnecessary objects
The mouse has to mark items that are not usable for the kindergarten and that need to be taken out. These include benches, shelves, the baptismal font, 
the altar and speakers. To simplify the search, these objects to be removed are highlighted with a particle effect. Marking is done with the interaction 
key E.

### Quest 2 - Find and eliminate defects
You have to identify areas of the church that are in poor condition and need to be repaired or replaced. Similar to the previous quest, the mouse here 
uses small sticky notes that make it clear to the architect that there is a defect. The marking is also done with the interaction key E.

### Quest 3 - Assign rooms
The architect needs help assigning new uses for the old rooms of the church. Once all four rooms have been assigned, the mouse must find the architect's 
plan to draw in its suggestions.

### Quest 4 - Concealing the hiding place of the mouse
The construction work has started and the mouse has to find a way to hide her tiny living room so that it won't be destroyed during the construction. 
So now it's her task to find two objects in the church that she can use to hide her two hiding entrances. These items are again highlighted with the 
familiar particle effect.
